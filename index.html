  const flashcards = [
    { question: "What is the role of vaccination in cancer prevention?", answer: "Vaccines like HPV and hepatitis B prevent infections that can lead to cervical and liver cancers." },
    { question: "How does obesity contribute to cancer risk?", answer: "Obesity promotes inflammation, hormone imbalances, and insulin resistance, increasing cancer risk." },
    { question: "What are the goals of secondary prevention in cancer?", answer: "Secondary prevention detects and treats precancerous changes early, preventing progression to invasive cancer." },
    { question: "Why is colorectal cancer screening essential, and what are the methods?", answer: "Detects early cancer and precancerous polyps; methods include FIT, colonoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy." },
    { question: "What are modifiable lifestyle factors that reduce cancer risk?", answer: "Avoiding tobacco, limiting alcohol, staying active, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a plant-based diet." },
    { question: "How does breast density impact mammography effectiveness?", answer: "Dense breast tissue reduces mammogram sensitivity, so additional imaging like ultrasound or MRI may be needed." },
    { question: "What is the difference between relative risk and absolute risk in cancer prevention?", answer: "Relative risk compares groups, while absolute risk measures the probability of developing cancer in a population." },
    { question: "What is the importance of low-dose CT in lung cancer screening?", answer: "Low-dose CT scans detect early lung cancer while minimizing radiation exposure, improving survival in high-risk individuals." },
    { question: "How does physical activity help in cancer prevention?", answer: "Physical activity lowers cancer risk by reducing inflammation, regulating hormone levels, and improving immune function." },
    { question: "What are the criteria for high-risk breast cancer screening?", answer: "High-risk individuals include those with BRCA mutations, family history of cancer, or prior chest radiation exposure." },
    { question: "What are barriers to cancer screening participation?", answer: "Barriers include lack of awareness, fear of results, cultural differences, and logistical or financial constraints." },
    { question: "How does tobacco use increase cancer risk?", answer: "Tobacco contains carcinogens that damage DNA, leading to mutations and increasing risk for multiple cancers like lung and oral cancer." },
    { question: "What is the significance of programmatic screening?", answer: "Programmatic screening ensures consistent quality control and follow-up care, reducing disparities compared to opportunistic screening." },
    { question: "How does alcohol consumption affect cancer risk?", answer: "Alcohol increases cancer risk by metabolizing into acetaldehyde, a carcinogen, and altering hormone levels, promoting tumor growth." },
    { question: "What are the key recommendations for cervical cancer screening?", answer: "Pap tests every 3 years for women aged 25â€“65, or HPV testing every 5 years. Stop screening after 65 if prior results were normal." },
    { question: "Why is chemoprevention controversial in some cases?", answer: "Side effects like thromboembolism and ethical concerns over prescribing preventive medication for asymptomatic individuals make it controversial." },
    { question: "What are the key cancer screening guidelines for prostate cancer?", answer: "PSA testing should be discussed with high-risk men; routine screening is not universally recommended." },
    { question: "What is the role of genetic testing in cancer prevention?", answer: "Genetic testing identifies individuals with hereditary cancer risks, allowing personalized screening and preventive strategies." },
    { question: "How does early detection of cancer improve survival rates?", answer: "Early detection identifies cancer at treatable stages, reducing mortality and improving outcomes through regular screenings." },
    { question: "What is the role of dietary fiber in colorectal cancer prevention?", answer: "Dietary fiber reduces risk by promoting healthy digestion, diluting carcinogens, and supporting gut microbiota." }
